## Overview

This Kedro project focuses on training and comparing the performance of three classical neural networks and three quantum neural networks. The goal is to evaluate and contrast their capabilities using the provided dataset. While the default Kedro project structure has been retained, the data and computations have been tailored to fit this specific experiment.

## How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `requirements.txt` for `pip` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

## How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the files `src/tests/test_run.py` and `src/tests/pipelines/data_science/test_pipeline.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. Run the tests as follows:

```
pytest
```

To configure the coverage threshold, look at the `.coveragerc` file.

## Project dependencies

To see and update the dependency requirements for your project use `requirements.txt`. You can install the project requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


## How to work with Kedro and notebooks

> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `catalog`, `context`, `pipelines` and `session`.
>
> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `pip install -r requirements.txt` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.

### Jupyter
To use Jupyter notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

### JupyterLab
To use JupyterLab, you need to install it:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

You can also start JupyterLab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

### IPython
And if you want to run an IPython session:

```
kedro ipython
```

> *Note:* Your output cells will be retained locally.
